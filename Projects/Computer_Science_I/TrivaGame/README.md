# Project Title

Trivia Challenge

## Project Description

The purpose of this project was to test the programmers Understanding of various data types and variables and their and implement.

This project is a series of questions and user inputs to create a functional Trivia game. The program will ask the user a question and prompt an answer. If the answer is right the answer will be tallied. At the end of the game the system will out print the percentage of answers the user got correct.
 
 This project reinforces the concepts of if-else loops as well as .equalsIgnoreCase.

## LessonsLearned

Along the way, I as the programmer have learned how to use and implement if-else loops as well as a basic understanding of how to use .equalsIgnoreCase. I've gotten better at being about to implement as use a scanner to efficiently get user inputs. Finally, I've learned how to use the debugger to help me debug my code.
